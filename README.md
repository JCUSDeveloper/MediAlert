I'm working on a **Medication Management System** that utilizes **Arduino technology** to help users remember to take their medications. This system provides:

- **Sound and Visual Alarms:** Alerts the user when it's time to take their medication.
- **Automated Compartments:** Opens the correct compartment in the pill organizer based on the scheduled medication time.

This project is designed to enhance medication adherence and improve user convenience.

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. I'm always open to collaborating and learning from others in the community.
